Lightweight Notebook Debut! :: 11/13/2019  15:37 UTC :: projects
I have created a fast and lightweight notebook for your note-taking needs. Your notes are saved automatically to your device each time you make a change. You will never have to experience a connection error or database failure again!

I am planning on building a cloud-based notebook later this year (towards December or early January 2019). This was a revamp project from my old editor which you can find [here](https://lste-1.vandesm14.repl.co/). I cleaned up a ton on unused and unneeded code. The new system doesn't even use my old custom library, which I'm not sure why I thought I needed it. Also with the new system comes an even smaller package with only 3 controls, New, Open, and Delete. These controls have been boiled down from the old 10+ controls, which were way too much. I highly suggest using this as it's actually all it says it is. It's a WYSIWYG app!
