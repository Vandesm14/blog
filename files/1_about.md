Hello! I am a 18 yo. full-stack web developer. I have been programming for about 4 years now. I mostly work on interactive websites, full-stack utility applications, and a few games here and there. I have quite a bit of experience in Nodejs, HTML/JS/CSS, JQuery, Git, Expressjs, and JSON Databases (for Nodejs). I find that being a web developer I am able to create and launch projects much quicker than if I were to use something like Java or Python (no hard feelings). I also find that being a developer in general allows me to bring my ideas and needs to life. If it's a game concept, needed utility app, or a site to share my accomplishments and experiences ([hint hint](https://blog.vandesm14.ml)), I always enjoy creating new projects. I will admit that I'm not the best at planning, as I have about 10 or more projects I've started but never returned to, but that won't stop me from finishing a worthwhile project for all to see.
