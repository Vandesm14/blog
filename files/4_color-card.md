Color Card Web-App :: 10/3/2019 15:03 UTC :: projects
In the fields of photo and video, it's difficult to sync colors for each camera unless you have a color card (which you'd have to make or buy). This app allows you to have a free color card. It also has a great feature, click on any color to expand it to full. Click it again to go back.

**Note:** This is not for syncing white balance, this is only used for referencing colors between cameras.
