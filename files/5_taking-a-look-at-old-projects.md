Taking a look at old projects :: 10/14/2019 15:23 UTC :: updates
Recently, I've been taking a look at some of my old projects. It's really cool when you see yourself in the past, immature with your code and definitely not organized. I saw some of my crappy games like a really simple [clicker](http://html-c2.vandesm14.repl.co) (which is still cool). I also took a look at an interesting "learning" [program](https://hdd-simulator.vandesm14.repl.co) for visualizing bytes and storage space. After taking a look at the rest, I began to realize truly how far I've come since the programs I wrote over 2 years ago. I'm now using JQuery and Nodejs servers, Socketio and REST API's, and more. I highly recommend looking back at your own programs to see how far **you've** come. It's cool to see your progress and to watch yourself grow as a developer!
