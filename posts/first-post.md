This is my **First Post** to my new blog! I will be posting **only** topics related to coding, which is mostly why my first blog failed. I have also reworked the system to support markdown. It runs off of files in a folder instead of an Airtable Database (which was annoying to use). So I hope *this* time the blog will do well. All I need is your help to make it work!
