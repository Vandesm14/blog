The pre-release of my blog is out! So as far as functionality goes, it **does** work, but not as efficiently as I would want it. In order to combat the bugs in the post fetching and managment system, I will have to rewrite it to support a LowDB instead of a normal JSON interaction bodge. I will be finishing up the official release shortly, just keep an eye out for the release on the [github repository](https://github.com/Vandesm14/blog)!
